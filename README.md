# ALX Airbnb Database Module Project  

## 📌 About the Project  
This project is part of the comprehensive **ALX Airbnb Database Module**, focusing on **database design, normalization, schema creation, and data seeding**.  

The goal is to design and implement a **production-level relational database system** for an Airbnb-like application. The project emphasises scalability, efficiency, and real-world functionality, reflecting the high standards required in professional database engineering.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives  
By completing this project, you will:  

- ✅ Apply **advanced database design principles** to model complex real-world systems.  
- ✅ Master the art of **normalization (up to 3NF)** to ensure efficiency and minimize redundancy.  
- ✅ Define robust schemas using **SQL DDL** with primary/foreign keys, constraints, and indexing.  
- ✅ Write and execute **SQL DML scripts** to seed the database with realistic sample data.  
- ✅ Develop **collaboration and documentation skills**, adhering to professional submission standards.

## ⚙️ Requirements  
To successfully complete this project, you must have:  

- Strong foundation in **relational databases and SQL**.  
- Proficiency with **Draw.io (or similar tools)** for ER modelling.  
- Solid understanding of **data normalization principles**.  
- Experience with **GitHub repositories** for collaboration and project submission.  
- Familiarity with **industry best practices** for database design and scripting.

## 🚀 Key Highlights  

### **Task 1: Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**  
- Design a detailed ERD to visualise the database structure.  
- Define entities, attributes, and relationships with clarity.  

### **Task 2: Normalization**  
- Apply normalization principles (up to **3NF**) to refine design.  
- Optimise data integrity and eliminate redundancy.  

### **Task 3: Schema Creation**  
- Write SQL **DDL scripts** to create tables with constraints.  
- Implement **primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes** for performance optimisation.  

### **Task 4: Data Seeding**  
- Write SQL **DML scripts** to insert realistic sample data.  
- Simulate a real-world Airbnb environment with **users, properties, bookings, and payments**.

## 🧑‍💻 How to Run  

1. Clone the repository:  

2. Run the schema file in your SQL environment:

```
SOURCE sql/schema.sql;
Populate the database with sample data:

SOURCE sql/seed.sql;
(Optional) Test queries for validation:

SOURCE sql/queries.sql;
```
